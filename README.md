# Parallel-Data-Processing
This source code is the example of practicing parallel partition/search/join/sort algorithms using python.
A round-robin partitioning and binary search are used together to maximise the speed for searching one specific value.
Another example contains a range partitioning with linear search algorithm to search a range of values.
